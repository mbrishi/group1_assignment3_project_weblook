            <p>Hello Visitor,</p>

            <p>
                When we started this project, we did not just want to build another static website, but to use data to tell a story that matters. That is why we chose to work with NYC motor vehicle collision data. It is real, relevant, and behind every number is a person, a moment, a consequence.
            </p>

            <p>
                How can data help us understand something as serious as traffic safety? How can we present that in a way that is clear, helpful, and insightful? Those questions guided everything from how we structured the site, to how we designed the charts, built the data model, and collaborated on each part of the project.
            </p>

            <p>
                We hope this dashboard reflects the thought, care, and teamwork we poured into it. It is simple, but meaningful to us, and we are proud to share it with you.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Thank you so much for stopping by,</p>
            <p style="margin:0; "><strong>Rishi, Safiya, Chi and Karthik.</strong></p>

                </div>
                <p>Our data model includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Location</strong> - Contains borough, zip, street, and coordinates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collision</strong> - Stores date, time, injuries, and related location.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vehicle</strong> -  Stores vehicle information involved in a collision.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Design Rationale:</strong> Data is recorded only when a collision occurs. Each collision is linked to one location and may involve multiple vehicles. Additionally, each vehicle can be involved in multiple collisions over time, establishing a many-to-many relationship between collisions and vehicles.</p>
